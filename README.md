Language server using engine allowing for smart jump-to-definitions, understanding metaprogramming definitions, refactoring and more.

Doing as MSc thesis for [Institute of Computer Science, University of WrocÅ‚aw](http://ii.uni.wroc.pl).

## Objectives

Create a language server for ruby, which can be used across different code editors, like Vim, Emacs or Atom. Focus on understanding of the code in order to provide best functionalities of "go-to definition", autocompletion and refactorings. The idea is to infer information about variables (i.e. their "types"), **without requiring developer to write any annotations**, just like IDEs do that - through static analysis.

## Current status

Currently language server supports:

### Hover request

Information about "type" of an expression


### Jump to definition

Works in following cases:
* used on constant -> jump to constant definition
* used on method call -> jump to definition of that method
* used on `super` keyword -> jump to the definition of method from the parent class (doesn't respect `include` / `prepend` yet)


### V i d e o

## Setup

### Prerequisite indexing

1. Install `orbacle` gem.
2. Run `orbaclerun -d <your_project_directory> index`

It will show you how long does it take to index your project, i.e. how long do you have to wait after editor start to have language server functional underneath.

### Vim

Using `vim-plug`:

```
Plug 'autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim', { 'branch': 'next', 'do': 'bash install.sh' }

let g:LanguageClient_serverCommands = {
  \ 'ruby': ['orbaclerun', 'file-server'],
  \ }
nnoremap <localleader>lj :call LanguageClient_textDocument_definition()<CR>
nnoremap T :call LanguageClient_textDocument_hover()<CR>
" timeout has to be bigger than time needed to index your project
let g:LanguageClient_waitOutputTimeout = 240
```

## Contributing

Currently I do not accept contributions, as this is part of MSc thesis. However features ideas and bug reports are accepted.

## Support

If you have found a bug, feel free to create an issue. However, because of the fact that I'm focusing now more on the features required to MSc, support for other developers are lower priority for me.
