Program allowing for smart jump-to-definitions, autocompletion, constant renaming and more.

Doing as MSc thesis for [Institute of Computer Science, University of Wroc≈Çaw](http://ii.uni.wroc.pl).

## Objectives

Create a language server for ruby, which can be used across different code editors, like Vim, Emacs or Atom. Focus on understanding of the code in order to provide best functionalities of "go-to definition", and later others like "show implementations", autocompletion and refactorings like "rename" etc. The idea is to infer information about variables (i.e. their "types"), without requiring developer to write any annotations, just like IDEs do that - through static analysis.

## Contributing

Currently I do not accept contributions, as this is part of MSc thesis. However features ideas and bug reports are accepted.
